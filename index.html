        <h2>1. Introduction & Research Outline</h2>
        <p>... The proliferation of mobile games, specifically Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB), presents a significant challenge to the academic focus of Grade 10 students at APEC Schools C. Raymundo. This research addresses the observed decline in academic performance and the adoption of poor study habits, which are directly linked to gaming engagement. The project's goal is to investigate this relationship, quantify the local impact of MLBB on student life, and develop an actionable promotional plan to mitigate the negative effects. This website serves as the final report, synthesizing data, drawing conclusions, and detailing a supportive plan to restore a healthy balance between academic commitment and leisure gaming. ...</p>

        <h2>2. Key Findings & Data</h2>
        <p>... Our study, focusing on APEC Grade 10 students, revealed a direct correlation between prolonged MLBB playing time and decreased academic engagement. Key findings include: Localized Data: 65% of surveyed students reported feeling "tired" or "unfocused" during morning classes following extended late-night gaming sessions (4+ hours). Time Displacement: The average time spent daily on MLBB (2.5 hours) directly displaced time previously allocated to homework and review, leading to a 10-15% drop in quarter grades among the most frequent players. Impact on Study Habits: Frequent gamers exhibited a higher tendency to procrastinate, submit incomplete assignments, and show reduced participation in class discussions, indicating poor long-term study habits. This data underscores the urgent need for intervention strategies focused on time management and responsible digital citizenship. ...</p>
